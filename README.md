## What I expect from a leader

I expect a leader to challenge the team internally with new and innovative projects, as well as improving current systems. A leader should be technically capable while possessing strong soft skills. A leader should set boundaries and ensure their team is capable of goals set. 

### Technical

- Ability to understand the long term technical picture
- Ability to grasp topics in the weeds and understand if they are truly valuable to the overall picture
- Up to date on current technical trends and strategies
- Always focused on long term success
- Ability to guide teammates to technical resources when struggling

### People

- Ability to explain technical terms to a non-technical crowd in a way that enables a holistic understanding of why a problem needs to be addressed and how many resources it will take
- Providing non-technical mentorship 
- Addressing skill gaps early in team members and looking to resolve them productively
- Encouraging diversity in hiring to foster ongoing innovation
- Ability to guide teammates to resources when struggling in other non-technical facets of life
- Recognizing that team members may face personal challenges and providing support as needed
