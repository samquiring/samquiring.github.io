## How you can help me

- I am always willing to take feedback and want to foster a positive work environment
- Loop me into current working sessions, I learn well from example
- Send me documentation on interesting topics even if they aren't directly related to my scope
- I love grabbing lunch and getting to know people, so feel free to stop by and ask if I'm free for lunch

## My working style

- I am confrontational in giving constructive feedback on ideas and expect the same from others
- I shine when working on ambiguous longer term problems, such as new feature requests
- I will work outside of standard hours for short stints but find my productivity quickly reduces when my work-life balance isn't in harmony
- I'm the most productive first thing in the morning and prefer saving my best hours for my deepest work
